Soil Moisture Monitoring and Email Notification System

Introduction
This IoT system continuously monitors soil moisture levels and automatically sends email notifications when moisture drops below configured thresholds. Designed for agricultural and gardening applications, the solution enables proactive plant care through real-time monitoring.

 Hardware Requirements
1. Microcontroller (Raspberry Pi)
2. Capacitive soil moisture sensor （ FC-28 ）
3. A plant to use and experiment with the probes
4. Breadboard and jumper wires
5. Micro-USB power supply

Steps
1. Connecting the Probe
2. Create a test Python Script (SoilSensor.py)
3. Adjust the potentiometer
4. Test the Email / Raspberry Pi feature
5. Combine Soil Sensor and Email source code ( SoilSensorEmail.py)

 Project Features
1.Real-time soil moisture monitoring
2.Monitoring the moisture content of the soil to optimize irrigation schedules
3. Monitoring the moisture content of the soil to optimize water resources
4.Monitoring drought conditions
5.Low-power operation mode
6.Detecting leaks in irrigation systems
7.Predicting crop yields
